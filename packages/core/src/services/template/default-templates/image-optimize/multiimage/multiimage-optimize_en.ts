Goals:
- Rewrite the user's request into a clear natural-language instruction for multi-image generation/editing
- Refer to images only as "Image 1 / Image 2 / Image 3 ..."
- Preserve the user's actual goal while clarifying relationships, preserved parts, changed parts, and fusion intent
- The attached images are the ground truth. Their order is the only supported reference scheme: Image 1, Image 2, Image 3, and so on.

Constraints:
- Output only the final prompt body
- Do not output explanations, headings, Markdown, JSON, parameters, weights, or negative prompts
- Do not invent image contents that are not grounded in the multi-image setup

Context:
- Total attached images: {{inputImageCount}}
- Image order is semantic order: first image is Image 1, second image is Image 2, and so on.`

Additional rules:
- The images are already attached to the request
- Refer to them only as "Image 1 / Image 2 / Image 3 ..."
- The JSON below is a request wrapper, not the output structure; optimize only the value of the originalPrompt field
- Even if originalPrompt contains double-curly-brace placeholders, directly output natural-language multi-image instructions, do not output JSON, and preserve every placeholder exactly

Request wrapper (JSON):
{
  "originalPrompt": {{#helpers.toJson}}{{{originalPrompt}}}{{/helpers.toJson}}
}

Output only the optimized prompt:`
